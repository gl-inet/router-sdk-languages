# Introduction

This repository is an Interface Language Pack for the GL.iNet Router SDK for localisation of GL.iNet products.

GL.iNet ensures the provision and maintenance of English and Chinese language packs for the interface, but we recognize that users worldwide seek to access the interface in their native language, as it is more familiar to them. Therefore, we have made the interface available for translation and sought assistance from dedicated users. Other languages have been translated with the generous help of our users.
It is important to note that GL.iNet cannot guarantee the completeness or quality of language packs other than those in English and Chinese.

# How to Update Language Packs

## Firmware version 4.6 and higher

Open the "Management Interface Languages" pop-up window via the button at the bottom of the language toggle list on the right side of the title bar, select the language you need and click "Update" and the device will automatically pull the latest version of the language pack from our repository.

## Firmware version 4.5

1. Find the matching Release from the [Releases](https://github.com/gl-inet/router-sdk-languages/releases) in this repository based on your firmware version.

2. Download the `gl-router-sdk-languages.zip` file provided with the Release.

3. Unzip the `gl-router-sdk-languages.zip` archive and find the JSON file for the required language. The filename should be `release.[code].json`, where `[code]` is the language code, as follows:
  * `de`: Deutsch
  * `en`: English
  * `es`: Español
  * `fr`: Français
  * `it`: Italiano
  * `ja`: 日本語
  * `ko`: 한국어
  * `pl`: Polski
  * `ru`: Русский
  * `zh-cn`: 简体中文
  * `zh-tw`: 繁体中文

4. Add the file to the `/www/i18n/` path with readable permissions for your device accessed via SSH/SCP. If you want to add French, you should include the `/www/i18n/release.fr.json` file.

5. Open or refresh your device's web admin panel and click the language toggle button located in the top right corner. Here, you will be able to view the recently added languages.

It is expected that in future releases we will add the ability to install language packs in one click directly from the web admin panel.

# How to Submit Translations

## Accessing the Translation Project

All interface languages are submitted via [GL.iNet's Self-hosted Weblate](https://weblate.gl-inet.com/engage/router-sdk/?utm_source=widget). To access the Router SDK project, simply visit the website and browse the available interface language packs.

*Please note that the language packs on this translation platform are updated in sync with the firmware development, and may not be fully synchronized with the release version. It is advisable to avoid directly pulling language pack files from the translation platform.*

## Editorial Suggestions
1.We use `$$$$` as a replacement variable, and we also use it to mark text buttons. Please keep it when you translate. For example, here are two examples:

2.In addition, for numeric + unit type variables, we use `{}` to mark numeric variables and `|` to distinguish between singular and plural forms.

## Submit a translation or accept a suggestion

New registered users can only submit suggestions, they cannot directly edit the translation. This is why the save button is disabled on the edit page.

After you have submitted a certain amount of usable text, we will invite you to become a translator. You can take suggestions from other people or translate text directly.
